# Chickynoid

A server-authoritative networking character controller for Roblox.

Maintained and written by MrChickenRocket and Brooke.


**Massive Work In Progress**

Fair warning, this is not ready for production in it's current form.
Feel free to have a look at it and see how it does what it does, though!



**What is it?**

Chickynoid is intended to be a replacement for roblox "humanoid" based characters. 
It consists of the chickynoid character controller, a character 'renderer' (TBD), and a framework on the client and server for managing player connections and network replication. 



**What does it do?**

Chickynoid heavily borrows from the same principals that games like quake, cod, overwatch, and other first person shooters use to prevent fly hacking, teleporting, and other "typical" character hacks that roblox is typically vulnerable to.

It implements a full character controller and character physics using nothing but raycasts (Spherecast when pls roblox?), and trusts nothing from the client except input directions and buttons (and to a limited degree dt).

It implements "rollback" style networking on the client, so if the server disagrees about the results of your input, the client corrects to where it should be based on the remaining unconfirmed input.



**What are the benefits**

Players can't move cheat with this. At all*
The version of the chickynoid on the server is ground-truth, so its perfect for doing server-side checks for touching triggers and other gameplay uses that humanoid isn't good at.
The chickynoid player controller code is fairly straightforward, and is more akin to a typical first person shooter player controller so slides along walls and up stairs in a generally pleasing way.

Turn speed, braking, max speed, "step up size" and acceleration are much easier to tune than in default roblox.



**What are the drawbacks?**

Building a character out of a sphere shape is generally a poor idea - rounded bottoms don't handle steps well, and the "belly" has to be handled if it catches on ledges.

The sweepcast module is **slow** and somewhat janky. This is a big deal, because having accurate fast collision detection is why noone else is doing this on the platform, and to be honest it's really **not quite there** yet.

This doesn't replace even a significant subset of what humanoids currently do. It's a platforming character and not much else right now.  

Your character is a ball, not a nice physically accurate mess like roblox uses.



**Whats todo**

Buffer underrun detection "Antiwarp" (so technically freezing your character is still possible right now)

Delta time validation (so technically speed cheating is still possible right now)

Character rendering (we dont replicate the avatar yet)

All the nice stuff surrounding controls like mobile controls and bindings



## How does it do it?

Rollback networking is just a new name for a really old technique I think that was invented first by John Carmack in the quake series.

The principle is that the real ground-truth version of your player only exists on the server, and the client sends inputs to the server to move it around.

The rest of it is just smoke and mirrors to make this still feel good and not laggy for the player, which is sometimes called player prediction.

The main idea is the "command". Every frame the client generates a comamnd, applies it to their local copy of the character (causing the player to simulate for 1 frame), and sends the same input to the server, which does the same thing.

The server, because it owns the authoritive version of the players, tells the player what the result of all the current commands it knows about are.

The server sends the validated view back to the client, and if the client disagrees, this is called a mispredict, and forces a resimulation (or rollback!) using all the currently unconfirmed client commands.

Maybe better explained via math?


A **Command** = the current sample of player inputs (what buttons they're holding, where they're aiming with the mouse etc) 

So the current state of the game for a single player game might be written as:

`State of game = SUM(All commands since game began)`


**So in Chicknoid:**



**On the server:**
`State of game = SUM(All confirmed player commands)`

**On the client:**
`State of game = (Last State of Game from server) + SUM(All unconfirmed player commands)`
