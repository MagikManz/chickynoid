    Handles communication between the server and client through Event objects.
    Unlike the [ServerTransport], the [ClientTransport] is a singleton. Only
    one Transport exists on the client and it is consumed by multiple
    different modules.

    TODO: In the future this should be implemented with some kind of BitBuffer
    to minimize network usage.

    Attaches connection to the remote so we can listen for events from the server locally.

    Also caches the replication remote before any consumers of [ClientTransport] try to use
    it. This is required to prevent unexpected yielding or errors when Transport methods
    rely on the remote.
